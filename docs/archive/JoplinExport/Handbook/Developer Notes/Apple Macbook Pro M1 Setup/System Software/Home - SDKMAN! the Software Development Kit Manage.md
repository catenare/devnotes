# The Software Development Kit Manager

**SDKMAN!** is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple **Software Development Kits** on most Unix based systems. It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates. Formerly known as **GVM** the **Groovy enVironment Manager**, it was inspired by the very useful **[RVM](https://rvm.io/)** and **[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)** tools, used at large by the Ruby community.

# By Developers, for Developers

Making life easier. No more trawling download pages, extracting archives, messing with `_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables.

# Java all the way down

Install Software Development Kits for the JVM such as Java, Groovy, Scala, Kotlin and Ceylon. Ant, Gradle, Grails, Maven, SBT, Spark, Spring Boot, Vert.x and many others also supported.

# Lightweight

Written in [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and only requires [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) and [zip/unzip](http://www.info-zip.org/) to be present on your system. Even works with [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/) too.

# Multi-platform

Runs on any UNIX based platforms: Mac OSX, Linux, Cygwin, Solaris and FreeBSD.

# APIs

New Clients can easily be written by consuming our open Broker REST API. Vendors can publish and announce their own releases through a secure Vendor API.

# Get started now!

Go on, paste and run the following in a terminal:
`$ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash`
