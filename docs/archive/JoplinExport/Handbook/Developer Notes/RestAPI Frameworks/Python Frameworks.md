* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) - FastAPI framework, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production
* [Sanic](https://sanicframework.org) - Async Python 3.6+ web server/framework
* [Falcon](https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - The Falcon Web Framework
```
Falcon is a minimalist WSGI library for building speedy web APIs and app backends. We like to think of Falcon as the Dieter Rams of web frameworks.
```
* [Hug](https://www.hug.rest) - Obvious. Clean. Radically simple.
```
Drastically simplify API development over multiple interfaces. With hug, design and develop your API once, then expose it however your clients need to consume it. Be it locally, over HTTP, or through the command line - hug is the fastest and most modern way to create APIs on Python3.
```
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) - Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code.
	* [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org) - Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs
```
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.
