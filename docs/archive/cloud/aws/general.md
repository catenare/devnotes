* Issues with mobile auth using email
  * [Github Issue 104](https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify/issues/104)
  * Use awsmobile cli
    * `awsmobile user-signin enable -p`
  * Did not get the aws amplify and mobile hub project to work. Had to create my own, custom setup.

* Seems to only way to deal with awsamplify not working is to create your own custom setup.
