# Deciding on a framework for mobile development

## Goals
* Rapid development.
    * Trying to get a quick prototype up and running to test out the feasability of the project
* Web initially
    * Create the equivalent of a mobile web site that can be packaged as a native app later. Can be a combination of both web and native.
* IOS first
    * Focused on developing an IOS app. Will port to Android. Maybe to Windows based on the framework.
* Web framework
    * Use JavaScript, CSS, HTML for putting together project.

## Tools
* Apache Cordova - underlying tool for the hybrid platform.
* AngularJS - JavaScript framework that seems to be most portable to NativeScript.
* TypeScript - write JavaScript with enterprise tools.

## Frameworks
* Ionic - Angular and typescript. Has an infrastructure around it. Can generate components with command line.
* Framework7 - Seems to have a variety of templates.
* OnsenUI - just not enough for me to bite.

## Thinking
* Starting with Framework7 template tool. See how far we can get. Goal is to create a web site that will suffice as a prototype for mobile site.
    * Not going to use Framework7. Uses less for css.
* Going to try and use ionic framework.

# Mobile Device Development Notes

## Android
* Google Tools
    * [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

### Solutions
* **Problem:** Launching Android SDK Manager without going through Atom Studio
  * *~/Library/Android/sdk/tools/android*
  * **For AVD** *~/Library/Android/sdk/tools/android avd*
      * [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16271242/launch-android-sdk-manager-tools-directory-doesnt-exist-mac)
      * Lauch AVD - [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8119282/dont-see-android-sdk-and-avd-manager-when-execute-android-tool-command)

## IOS
### IOS Development Notes

* Cocoapods
    * Issue: *Unable to add a source with url https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git named master. You can try adding it manually in ~/.cocoapods/repos or via pod repo add*
    * [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33649114/since-i-installed-xcode-7-1-1-and-updatet-on-osx-10-11-1-i-get-an-git-error)
```
    cd ~/.cocoapods/repos
    git clone git://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git master
    pod install --no-repo-update --verbose
```
* Actual issue: I'm in South Africa and it was taking forever to do the initial repo specs checkout. Doing git clone git:/github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git master into ~/.cocoapods/repos resolved the problem. Going forward, only has to update the repos, not completely download it.

# Ionic Development Notes
Trying to figure out Ionic while building a prototype to demo via the web.
## Notes
* Pushing site to gh-pages.
    * Ref: [Deploying an Angular App to Github Pages](https://alligator.io/angular/deploying-angular-app-github-pages/)
    * Ionic starter template includes the manifest and worker file by default.
    * Use the ionic build scripts to create the web version of your app.
    1. Install *angular-cli-ghpages* globally
        * `npm install --global angular-cli-ghpages`
    1. Build ionic app with base-href to github gh-url for your username
        * `npm run ionic:build --prod --base-href "https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/"`
    1. Push to gh-pages. `ngh --dir www` - have to use *www* because the script looks for the *dist* folder by default.
