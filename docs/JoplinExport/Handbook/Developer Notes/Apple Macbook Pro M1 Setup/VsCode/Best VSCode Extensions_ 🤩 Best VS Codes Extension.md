One of the best features is the [**Market Place**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) offering tons of extensions to customize it exactly to your needs and helping you in writing high-quality code.

In this article, we will recommend these VS Code extensions for front-end engineers working with CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and frameworks like Angular, ReactJS, and VueJS.
We at [ThemeSelection](https://themeselection.com/) is using some of these extensions to create Modern & Clean Bootstrap Admin Template.

[Vuexy - Vuejs, React, HTML & Laravel Admin Dashboard Template](https://themeselection.com/go/download-vuexy-vuejs/)

[Apex - React Admin Template with Bootstrap + Redux](https://themeselection.com/go/download-apex-react/)

[Chamaleon Free Bootstrap Admin Template](https://themeselection.com/products/chameleon-admin-free-bootstrap-dashboard-template/)

You can also check some [free bootstrap admin template](https://themeselection.com/) made using these extensions.

We would say this collection is not the complete one and the extensions are not necessarily the best but we hope it helps you to select the best tools to help you write high-quality code and become the best web developer.

If you think this list is missing an extension feel free to suggest and extend it by adding your favorite in the comments section.

Ohh I didn't any face memory issues while working with it
I have 8GB ram with chrome, vscode, other small tools open at all times
And I'm working on a big website project

Don't know why I had faced this problem. Ok I will try Tab Nine again, thanks😊

Markdown All in One is a bit too much of a kitchen sink approach for my taste. If you just want to choose specific extensions for what you need in markdown, try the following:

- [Marky Dynamic](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robole.marky-dynamic): Table of Contents and other dynamic content. It will auto-update on save.
- [Markdown Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robole.markdown-snippets): Extended Markdown snippets for quickly adding tables and task lists.
- [Marky Edit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robole.marky-edit): Toggle-style editing.

Thank you for the selection. Some were already in my installed list (this is a proof of the selection quality 😋).

By the way, the author of Bracket Pair Colorizer recommends v2: [marketplace.visualstudio.com/items...](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)

> - Differences between v1 and v2?
>     - v2 Uses the same bracket parsing engine as VSCode, **greatly increasing speed and accuracy**. A new version was released because settings were cleaned up, breaking backwards compatibility.

awesome list 👌
be careful with Quokka tho, as you can mess up the code pretty quickly if you experiment with it in different parts of code simultaneously 😉

If you want watch time log of project, language, time code in the day, the week, I recommend Waka plugin. Error Lens plugin: Improve highlighting of errors, warnings and other language diagnostics.
